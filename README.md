# Live notice board - sample task PHP
### Output
A notice board (e.g. www.example.com/notice-board) which shows messages live as
admins enter them (in the backend), without having to refresh the browser. This page is public.
The stories are entered by the admin on a separate page, e.g. www.example.com/adminaddstory.php. Admin has to login first to get to this page. Stories should allow HTML.

### Other points:
* Using of DB is a must, when cross checking credentials with DB
* Content should be updated via the use of Javascript Ajax libraries, instead of refreshing
the page
* Must-use requirements are Core PHP (No frameworks or templates) and MySQL, with
everything else youâ€™re free
